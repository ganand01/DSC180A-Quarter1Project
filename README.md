# Usage
1. Clone this repository on your local machine
2. Open your terminal
3. Change (cd) into the directory to the cloned repository
4. Type  ``` pip install -r requirements.txt```. This contains all the necessary packages for running the code.
5. Use run.py to execute the code. Type ```python run.py {specify dataset to run}``` in your terminal. Where it says {specify dataset to run}, replace this with the dataset and only the specified dataset will be trained and tested on all of the models. If no dataset is specified and you just type ```python run.py```, all of the datasets will be trained and tested on all of the models.
